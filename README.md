# 📝 Personal Blog App

Welcome to **MSR’s Personal Blog App** — a simple, elegant blog built using **Node.js**, **Express**, and **EJS**, styled to be clean, responsive, and full of heart ❤️.

This app lets me share personal posts dedicated to the most important people in my life — my sister, my mom, and more to come. It’s not just a project... it’s a story in code.
